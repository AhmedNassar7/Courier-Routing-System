# Courier-Routing-System
An application that optimizes courier routes using graph algorithms. 
The program read a list of pickup and delivery locations, along with the deadlines for
each delivery, and then find the shortest route to visit each pickup location, deliver
the packages to me, and return to the starting point. 
The program also allows the user to add and remove pickup and delivery locations as needed.
